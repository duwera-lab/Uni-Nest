Deliverable 1: Business Pitch Document
- A **clear, specific explanation of your AI component**:
What AI does (task, input/output):AI Specification AI in Uni-Nest performs both conversational and analytical tasks. It integrates directly into the chatbot and personalization panel. · Tasks: recommendation, summarization, and interactive guidance. · Inputs: profile and listing data, and chat prompts. · Outputs: compatibility scores, location suggestions, financial summaries, and document checks. · Benefits: faster decision-making, reduced scams, better user confidence and improved messaging. · Risks: potential bias in recommendations and data privacy concerns—mitigated by transparency and secure deletion options. Strategic Rationale: Uni-Nest keeps AI explainable and supportive, aligning with its mission to empower students with clarity and trust rather than replace human judgment.
